LMS - Lock Management System Using Face Detection

The Lock Management System (LMS) leverages face detection technology to enhance security by enabling locks to open based on facial recognition. While this approach is convenient and increasingly common, it has inherent vulnerabilities. For instance, traditional face detection systems can be deceived by a photograph of an authorized person, compromising security.

To address this limitation, we implemented a face liveliness detection mechanism, which ensures that the lock responds only to a live individual. By incorporating eye detection and blink detection, the system verifies liveliness before granting access. This additional layer of security significantly enhances the reliability of the lock management system, preventing unauthorized access through static images and ensuring a more robust and secure solution
